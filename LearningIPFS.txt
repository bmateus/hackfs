Idea:

Simple smart contract that creates a *unique* non-transferrable NFT for a wallet address that can save profile information
- a profile image that links to an IPFS CID
- a profile name 
- additional profile info (statu, description, whatever)

User can interact with the profile smart contract from a web app that allows
	- create a profile NFT
	- uploading an image to IPFS and returns a CID
	- set other profile info
	- "save" the changes to their profile NFT

Another app that searches for a profile NFT and uses it to display the users profile:
A twitter-like messaging app:
	- displays the user's profile info
	- allows the user to post a message, saving it in ipfs, and saving the CID in a smart contract (the user's message feed)

- Both web apps will be hosted on IPFS
